# Deployment Guide

## Node.js Version Compatibility Issue Fix

The deployment was failing due to a Node.js version mismatch with `better-sqlite3`. Here's what has been fixed:

### 1. Package.json Updates
- Added `postinstall` script to rebuild `better-sqlite3` for the target platform
- This ensures the native module is compiled for the correct Node.js version

### 2. Database Error Handling
- Added comprehensive error handling for database initialization
- Fallback to in-memory database if file system access fails
- Graceful error handling for all database operations

### 3. Node.js Version Specification
- Added `.nvmrc` file specifying Node.js version 22.9.0
- Added deployment configuration for better-sqlite3

## Deployment Steps

1. **Ensure Node.js Version**: Use Node.js 22.9.0 or compatible version
2. **Install Dependencies**: Run `npm install` or `yarn install`
3. **Rebuild Native Modules**: The postinstall script will automatically rebuild better-sqlite3
4. **Build Application**: Run `npm run build` or `yarn build`
5. **Deploy**: The application should now deploy successfully

## Platform-Specific Notes

- **Vercel/Netlify**: May need to use `@sveltejs/adapter-node` for server-side functionality
- **Railway/Render**: Should work with the current configuration
- **Docker**: Ensure the Dockerfile uses the correct Node.js version

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter issues:

1. Check the Node.js version matches `.nvmrc`
2. Ensure the deployment platform supports native modules
3. Consider using a different database adapter if SQLite is not supported
4. Check the deployment logs for specific error messages

The application now has robust error handling and should gracefully handle database initialization failures.
